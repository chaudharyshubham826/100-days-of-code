# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 14, 2022
<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Went through easy questions on stacks and queues on InterviewBit. Refreshing... Gone through few tutorials on C++

**Thoughts:** Felt good today, finally starting. Instead of focussing on multiple things like C++ question, theoretical C++, algorithmic questions, OOPS together, I should instead focus on one thing in a day. C++ prep did help though. Going to tweet:)
